The search for pricing information on the chatbot platforms returned limited results. The only relevant information found was on Netomi's website, which did not provide specific pricing information. However, the search did provide some general information on the use of chatbots in the banking industry, including their ability to reduce costs, improve customer satisfaction, and increase efficiency. Additionally, the search provided some information on the features and capabilities of the chatbot platforms, such as their ability to handle customer queries via various channels, their use of natural language processing, and their integrations with various customer service platforms.
